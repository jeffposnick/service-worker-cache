The [live demo](https://jeffposnick.github.io/service-worker-cache/components/service-worker-cache/demo.html) works in the current [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html) with the [experimental web features](chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features) flag turned on.

See the [component landing page](https://jeffposnick.github.io/service-worker-cache) for information about using this as a Polymer element.
